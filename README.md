This research presents an advanced deep learning framework for **video classification and action recognition**, leveraging **ConvLSTM** and **LRCN** architectures to model both spatial and temporal dependencies in video sequences. By systematically extracting and analyzing motion patterns, the system demonstrates high classification accuracy, achieving **85-90%** on the **UCF50 dataset**. The framework is designed for applications in **security, surveillance, and motion analysis**, offering robust performance in dynamic environments requiring real-time human activity recognition.
